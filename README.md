# Lending Club Case Study
> When the company receives a loan application, it has to make a decision for loan approval based on the Applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision: If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company. If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company. The Shared data contains the information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not. Calculated Analysis on Interest rate Loan Amount and STatus CHarged Off.

## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
- Given Dataset is a previous years of Loan Details History based upon the status and loan details
- We have to identify that a person who applied for the loan would recieve the same or it will be defaulter in any case?
- Loan csv file which is having more than hundred columns details of users?

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- It is clear that avearge intrest rate is highest for small business purpose and increases with Loan Amount as well
- Loans taken for small business purposes had to repay the loan with more intrest rate as compared to other
- probably when loan amount is more it is taken for longer loan term, we saw earlier that longer the loan term more the interest rate.
- Distribution of amounts for all three (Loan Amount, Funded Amount, Funded Amount Invert)looks very much similar
